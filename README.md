# Lawnicons extra
## A fork of Lawnicons with some extra Icons I, [@TGRush](https://github.com/TGRush), added to the base pack

### What is Lawnicons even?
Lawnicons is Lawnchair's "Extension" to Lawnchair 12, which allows the launcher to theme Icons based on wallpaper which aren't supported by Google
It doesn't generate them on-the-fly, but has some pre-made Icons which are used to do this

### How to install Lawnicons?
**these instructions go for both, the original, and this Fork**

1. Get Lawnchair 12 from **Github Actions** (NOT from their stable releases) ***Make sure you're logged into Github first***
2. Get a Lawnicons from releases tab here, or in the "Actions" tab on the [original repo](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/Lawnicons)
3. Install both
4. Enable "Themed Icons" under Lawnchair Settings > General 
5. Enjoy themed Icons!
***Note: These Icons don't work in the appdrawer, presumably this is intentional***

### Requesting Icons
Requesting is simple.
Just do the following:
Send an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) of an app icon of your choice
Send the package name of that app
Send the name of the app

# This is WIP at the moment, anything about this fork and the original may change at any time without warning
### Also most of these icons aren't made from their real SVGs but rather some gimp and conversion tools
